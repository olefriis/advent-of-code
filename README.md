# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to Advent of Code. I did 2020 as the first year, which means that folder is a complete
mess of really ugly code and sometimes cleaned-up "take two" versions. I primarily used Ruby, but tried to
re-implement some of the solutions in Rust on the days where I had a little extra time later in the day.

For 2019, I am trying to go slower (because there's no competition - I am a year late) and do everything in
Rust.

# Day 25

This took longer than expected, and I guess `run_1.rs` only works for my input. I first had to
draw a map of all the rooms and the connections between them, and after picking up all the
items along the way, of course the droid was too heavy to pass the security checkpoint. So the
very last puzzle was to find out exactly which items to drop and which to keep in order to
carry the correct weight.

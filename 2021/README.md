# Advent of Code 2021

These are all my solutions to Advent of Code 2021. All solutions are written in Ruby.
Some of them are super crappy solutions, while for others I've taken the time to
polish and optimize the solutions. Please don't judge me based on everything here :smile:

Most folders contain two scripts: `run_1.rb` and `run_2.rb`. These are solutions for
part 1 and part 2 of the puzzles, resp. Sometimes I've merged the two into a single
solution, `run.rb`, and for others I have several solutions that I've wanted to conserve,
in which case there are weird files like `run_2_2.rb` etc.

For each of the solutions, you can `cd` to the day, put the input in a file called `input`
in that folder, and then you can just run e.g. `ruby run_1.rb`. Some scripts just give you
the answer, while others have debug output, but none of them require any dependencies
except a relatively recent version of Ruby.

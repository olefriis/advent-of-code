# Day 15

Big news! I finally split out the Intcode stuff to its own file. I'm so proud!

Uh, and using type aliases for the first time!

Part 1 took way too long for me because of a simple bug (not updating `current_position` in the loop in the `move_to`
function), but otherwise worked fine. Maybe I over-engineered the solution with types etc., but it felt good.

# Advent of Code 2019

My Rust solutions. I am using these exercises to practise Rust, so I'm sure this is not idiomatic Rust.

## How to Run

There is a Cargo binary for each part of each day. They are named `<day>-<part>`, so to run part 1 of day
3, do:

```
$ cargo run --bin 3-1
```

In each day's directory, typically an `input` file should be put there. I haven't committed my own input,
so you'll have to grab you own input and put in an `input` file.

# Day 12

Part 1 was pretty easy. Looking back, part 2 was also pretty easy, but my brain just didn't work that day
(slept bad to start with, and then got woken by a pager at 4AM)... Anyhow, you can look at the history of
the file. I started out with an advanced solution adding up the number of paths visiting each big cave once
and adding the number of paths visiting a certain big cave exactly twice etc.

Anyhow, it turned out that just checking the paths for validity when going along is by far fast enough for
this puzzle input, so that's what I've refactored it to.

# Day 16

Lots of specifications in this puzzle. Getting that right was the core part.

I really thought that we would revisit this expression evaluator, so I took some
time to clean it up and put it in the `expression_evaluator.rb` file along with a
few simple tests. However, this turned out to be a one-off, so this was wasted
effort (except for the learnings along the way, of course).

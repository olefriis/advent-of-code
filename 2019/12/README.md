# Day 12

I really needed a regular expression engine for parsing this input, but as I am trying to stick to not
using any crates, I ended up with some crappy parsing code.

Part 2 was nice! It both took a bit of thinking to find an approach, and then some fiddling with primes.
There may be an extremely simple way of solving this part that I don't know about, but I'm relatively
happy with my approach.

# Day 13

I loved this puzzle, mostly because it reminded me of certain classes at University where the teacher
would prepare sets of transparent paper that were put on top of each other to gradually introduce new
concepts.

The folding coordinates - for example `2 * coordinate - pos.x` for folding along the x axis - took me
a bit too long to grok, since it's so simple and seems so contra-intuitive..

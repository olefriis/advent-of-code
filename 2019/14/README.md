# Day 14

Nice exercise!

Part 1, I mostly struggled with Rust. Working with stuff owned by e.g. a HashSet is tedious. I maybe shouldn't be afraid
of using `.clone()` more often...

Rust noted:
* I wish I could just give a predicate to HashSet, and HashSet would remove the matching elements and return them! Maybe
  this is already possible, but I couldn't find the method.

# Day 20

Part 1 was relatively straightforward. The worst part was parsing the portals - not very pretty code. And then - sigh! - yet
another shortest-path algorithm.

Part 2 was - sigh! sigh! - yet another shortest-path algorithm. Luckily it wasn't that much work changing the position to be
multi-dimensional, and finding out whether a portal is an outside or inside portal was also pretty straightforward. (Not that
I'm too proud of the resulting code, though.)

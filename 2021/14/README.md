# Day 14

A very nice puzzle, and with a typical Advent of Code twist in part 2.

I got the idea for part 2 really quickly, but took a looong time to get it right, because I had not
considered that line 1 in the input could contain duplicate characters. Once I realized that (after
a LOT of debugging), the correct answer instantly popped out.

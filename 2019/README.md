# Advent of Code 2019

My Rust solutions. I am using these exercises to practise Rust, so I'm sure this is not idiomatic Rust.

## How to Run

There is a Cargo binary for each part of each day. They are named `<day>-<part>`, so to run part 1 of day
3, do:

```
$ cargo run --bin 3-1
```

In each day's directory, typically an `input` file should be put there. I haven't committed my own input,
so you'll have to grab you own input and put in an `input` file.

## Conclusions

These puzzles were, just like for 2020 that I had done before, amazing! I love when the first part is
relatively easy, and then the second part completely changes the game.

Overall, I guess there are two themes for the puzzles: Implementing and then using the Intcode computer,
and doing lots of shortest-path algorithms. And some other puzzles spread in between. Lots of variation.

Day 18 and day 22 were by far the hardest for me. Day 21 was also challenging, but in a super fun way.

I've come to enjoy programming in Rust, even though it can be super frustrating at times. It definitely
added a whole new dimension to the puzzles.

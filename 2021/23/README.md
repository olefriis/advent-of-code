# Day 23

That morning, I was super stubborn! I was sure there was some insight that would allow me
to not implement the rules of how the amphipods can move around, so I set out to solve the
first part manually. That eventually worked, but took me FAR too long. And for part 2, it
was obvious that a manual approach wouldn't work. At least for me.

So... no way around wrapping up the sleeves and implementing those rules. It's a huge,
unreadable blob of code that can probably be made much simpler and more readable. But I
don't really have the energy to go and do that - maybe some other time.

Also, I didn't even bother writing an input parser here, so my puzzle input is embedded in
the script. That's a bit sloppy I know, but I didn't think it was worth it, given the
complexity of the puzzle input format and the very little information that is embedded in
it.

# Day 16

A bit silly exercise, but fun to implement an iterator in Rust.

Part 1 takes surprisingly long to run. Which, of course, makes part 2 completely infeasible to brute-force
using the same algorithm.

The twist for part 2 is typical for Advent of Code: You think you got the perfect solution, but then try
to solve THIS thing with it!

It took me quite a while to come up with the solution to part 2, but of course it turned out to be a super
simple implementation.

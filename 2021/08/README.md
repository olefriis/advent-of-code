# Day 8

Part 1 was super easy, while part 2 was super fiddly. I started out trying to write down all the similarities
between the digits, but while also trying to feed the kids, brush their teeth etc. during the morning routine,
I wrote notes I couldn't read myself 5 minutes later, and they turned out to be super buggy anyway.

Eventually I ended up in a Pry debugging session where I did a number of `Array#filter` operations comparing
how many connections were in common between the not-yet-identified and the identified digits. Once I was there,
getting everything right was easy.

# Day 9

First part is prety easy.

For part 2, I didn't realize that each basin is bordered by `9`s. That would have greatly simplified my
approach. (I'm still not entirely sure that you can read that part from the puzzle description, but
apparently it's the case for the actual puzzle input as well for everybody.) So I spent some time
implementing a graph coloring algorithm starting from the low points.
